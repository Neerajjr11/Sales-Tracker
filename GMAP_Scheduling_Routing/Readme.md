### Interactive Routing System
Interactive Routing System uses the Mapbox API, the app retrieves visited locations from the database, uses the API to use latitude and longitude, and uses routing algorithms to create schedules and travel route.

Application Scope:
- Applications include identifying network or hardware optimization methods.
- Very useful for salesman as this system is often concerned with finding the cheapest solution.

Notes:
- It is an algorithmic problem tasked with finding the shortest route between a set of points and locations that must be visited.
- The goal is to keep both the travel costs and the distance traveled as low as possible.

## The way it works:
* Routing is accomplished through sales routing scheduling using recursive bitmasking approach.
* You enter the values of latitude and longitude.
* A graph is drawn with edges and nodes representing salesman.
* Setting node values as a bitmasking approach.It finds the shortest time at the best possible cost.
* It runs recursively to find the shortest path with the best possible cost until it runs out of nodes.
* A calendar is also provided to maintain the schedule of salesman.
